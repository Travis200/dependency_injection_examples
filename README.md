# Dependency Injection Examples

## Overview

I created this project to demonstrate the three main methods of performing dependency injection "by hand". This is an application that mocks a real life Cafe and orders drinks for the user. This application demonstrates how the cafe application could be implemented with **constructor injection**, **method injection** and **property injection**.
